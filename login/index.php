<?php
  // To make sure we don't need to create the header section of the website on multiple pages, we instead create the header HTML markup in a separate file which we then attach to the top of every HTML page on our website. In this way if we need to make a small change to our header we just need to do it in one place. This is a VERY cool feature in PHP!
  require "header.php";
?>



<?php
  // And just like we include the header from a separate file, we do the same with the footer.
  require "footer.php";
?>
